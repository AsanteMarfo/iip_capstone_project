# ðŸ“± Telecom Customer Churn Prediction App

This project aims to predict whether a telecom customer will **Churn**, **Stay**, or **Join**, based on various factors such as tenure, charges, internet type, contract type, and more.

## ðŸŽ¯ Objective

The goal is to help telecom companies identify which customers are at risk of leaving (churning), so they can take proactive steps like targeted offers, improved service, or loyalty programs.

## ðŸ“ˆ Metrics & Evaluation

- **Accuracy**: Measures how many predictions were correct.
- **Precision**: How many predicted churns were actually correct.
- **Recall**: How many actual churns we successfully caught.
- **F1 Score**: Balance between Precision and Recall.
- **ROC Curve**: Visual tool to show modelâ€™s ability to distinguish between classes (ideal = closer to top-left).

These metrics help the business:
- Understand how reliable the model is.
- Identify which group of customers need more focus.
- Take data-driven actions to retain high-value users.
